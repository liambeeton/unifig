// The replay stand-in is how the WAN slots get tested at the same seam as
// everything else.
//
// The dockerized Controller substitutes for a UDR everywhere it can, and WAN is
// where it cannot: with no gateway attached it has no WAN entries at all, so
// there is nothing to match, nothing to update, and nothing a seeded LAN could
// honestly stand in for. What takes its place is not a mock of unifig's client
// but a Controller at the same seam — recorded responses served over HTTPS,
// behind the same base URL, through the same API-key header, to the same real
// unifig binary. Nothing in unifig knows the difference, which is the whole
// point: swap the recording for a real UDR's and the same tests still describe
// the same behaviour.
//
// It holds the recorded networkconf in memory and updates its copy on a PUT,
// the way the Controller updates its own — replaying a fixed answer would make
// "apply converged, and the next plan is empty" impossible to state, and that
// sentence is the contract this suite exists to check.

// Recorded endpoints. Everything unifig asks a Controller for while planning,
// applying or exporting is one of these; anything else arriving here is a
// change in what unifig does, and the stand-in says so rather than 404ing
// quietly.
